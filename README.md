# Andos_Reviews
A beginner-friendly, cloud-ready anime review site built using Rocky Linux, NGINX, and HTML ‚Äî deployed on a local VM as the foundation for a cloud engineering portfolio project

## Anime Review Site

This project is part of my cloud engineer portfolio. It starts with a basic static website hosted on a Rocky Linux VM using NGINX, and will be progressively modernized with:

- Git for version control
- Python for dynamic content
- Docker for containerization
- Terraform for cloud infrastructure
- CI/CD pipelines
- AWS services (S3, Lambda, EC2, VPC, etc.)

üõ†Ô∏è Skills Demonstrated:
- Linux system administration (Rocky Linux - RHEL compatible)
- Web server configuration with NGINX
- Git/GitHub for code management
- Command-line usage (no GUI)
- Local VM networking (port forwarding)
